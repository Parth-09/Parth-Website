            <p> This application is based on the technology called Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality is an upcoming field which brings in a lot of new innovations and research for future generations to come. This Project in particular focuses on the different locations in the world. The project has a basic functionalty that uses a cube as a medium to get detected by the AR Camera in Unity and it will display the design/content that the creator of the program would want it to display.</p>

          <p> This project mainly focuses on deploying unity on the oculus quest and playing around in the area via creating your own game boundary. It also involves features such as interactions with objects and physics. Moreover, it involves a shop scenario where one could sell stuff and includes items that are animated using the C# script. Lastly, there are 3d sounds that amplify as the user would get closer to the 3d objects.</p>

          <p>This project is based on unity where we move inside the computer science building at UIC with a fixed theme. This theme has a little flexibility to it as we go around the building. The theme that I have picked for this project would be "Christmas". There a bunch of different grabbable objects and teleportation points set in the atrium space and one can also use the lever to make the christmas tree disappear. There are two buttons one on the desk of the shop and another is on the third floor and one can use both these buttons to spawn objects by tapping them. </p>

            <p>In the virtual reality game I Expect You to Die, players must solve puzzles in a variety of situations, such as getting out of an airplane in a car or surfacing an underwater escape pod.
                The majority of events have a time limit and demand rapid thinking to continue.
                The environment contains objects that appear to be randomly placed but actually serve a purpose that the player must discover in order to complete the puzzle and succeed.
