    <h3>Project2: One More Cup Of Coffee</h3>
    <p>This project mainly focuses on deploying unity on the oculus quest and playing around in the area via creating your own game boundary. It also involves
    features such as interactions with objects and physics. Moreover, it involves a shop scenario where one could sell stuff and includes items that
    are animated using the C# script. Lastly, there are 3d sounds that amplify as the user would get closer to the 3d objects.</p> 
    <p> These are a few examples of how it shall look on the screen: <br> <br>

  </p>
  <p>The following methods were used to build this application:</p>
  1. Unity -> Here's a link to download the latest version of Unity(2021.3.6f1): <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> <br>
  2. VRTK -> Version 4 (It is built in Unity), one would need to go to build settings and swtich platform to android to build and run this program on quest.</p>

  A little discusion post regarding the use of Virtual Reality in real life: <br><br>
  In this world of virtual reality innovations and research is continuing to grow. This project helps us understand the basic difference between a virtua world compared to a real world. 
  The previous project talked about how iun an augmented reality a person could possibly make an interactive design for users to interact with however this project mainly focuses on the key aspect of using a quest. 
  In the initial stages of the project the simulator serves as a helping hand and lets us run the project and test it out. Since the simulator would just be a display it only allows us to interact with the objects using WASD keys. 
  However, the quest allows us to stay in a virtual environment where the design that is displayed in the same spectrum as we stand in a room full of chairs and tables is different. 
  This gives us a real life experience of being in a completly different world when we are actually not physically present in that place. Thus when we use the quest we just have two controllers that act like our arms and let us go through the multiple options available to us in the very same virtual environment. 
  When using a simulator the keys do not give an interactive experience as the quest since we are just moving around using the keys and grabbing items using the mouse. 
  However, the quest will allow us to grab the items with the controllers that actually represent our arms in a virtual world which makes it more interactive. 
  Moreover, the frame rate in the simulator would be a lot higher than the quest since the quality and the graphics and processing of a computer would be a lot better than a quest. 
  If we try and improve the quality of the items present in our program we would need to make sure to reduce the polygons and the quality of the objects in general to run this program smoothly and efficiently without any lag. 
  This also implies the fact that simulators would have a better standing if one had to better the design or the quality of a place or an object or had to add more detailing to their project compared to a quest. 
  And as we discussed in the last project that simulators are used for training pilots, firefighters, other trainees that might be under a lot of threat during an actual real life flight or a military operation, etc. correctly fits the criteria here. 
  One could add a lot more detail to the simulator that shall be more precise. Virtual reality is a growing field and soon there shall be additional graphics and better quality involved when it comes to using virtual reality in our day to day lives.
